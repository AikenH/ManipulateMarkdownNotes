## Desc

this repo if for those code which multiply the markdown file,to adapt all blog format or some record use. most of those script can be out of date now.(which is write early 2020, may be optimize/rewrite this year.)

### new code

**ExtraTagCate.py** : extra metadata from markdown file, and generate tag & catagory file like:

{tag}.md and content like:

- [[file1]] : {subtitle}
- ...

which is used to generate obsidian relation map, and catagory should work better for this purpose.

### old code.

- genpost4hexo: add metadata for markdown file for hexo.
- md2icarus: add '<--more-->' and metadata: toc for markdown
- md2notion: deal with latex symbol to support notion.
- texmd2blog: USING replace of $$->abcde,$->$$,abcde->$$, format inline tex for gitbook

## FI
